## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Copy files** into your theme root:
   - `blocks/product-bundle-offers.liquid` → `blocks/`
   - `assets/bundle-offers-v2.js` → `assets/`
   - `assets/enhanced-add-to-cart.js` → `assets/`
   - Optionally: `snippets/add-to-cart-button-enhanced.liquid`, `snippets/bundle-cart-adapter.liquid` → `snippets/`

2. **Add the block** – Theme editor → Product page → Add block → **Bundle Offers**. Configure tiers, pricing, free gifts, badges.

3. **Add to cart** – Ensure the product form has an Add to cart button; the bundle script intercepts it. For dynamic price on the button, use the enhanced snippet (see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)).

4. **Cart** – Works with redirect to `/cart` out of the box. For drawer integration, see [Cart drawer integration](docs/cart-drawer-integration.md).

## 🧩 How It Works – Architecture Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Customer visits product page] --> B{Product has Bundle Offers block?}
    B -->|No| C[Normal product behavior]
    C --> C1[Standard price and Add to cart]
    B -->|Yes| D[Load bundle block and pricing]
    D --> E[Customer selects bundle tier]
    E --> F[Dynamic price updates on button and block]
    F --> G[Customer clicks Add to cart]
    G --> H[Bundle script adds items to cart with discount]
    H --> I{Cart experience}
    I -->|Theme listens for cart-drawer:open / cart:update| J[Open theme cart drawer and refresh]
    I -->|Theme or app listens for bundle:cart-added| K[Open custom drawer or app drawer]
    I -->|Redirect to cart| L[Go to /cart page]
    J --> M[Customer sees cart with correct total]
    K --> M
    L --> M
```

**Summary:** The widget loads on product pages that use the Bundle Offers block, updates the displayed price when a tier is selected, and on add-to-cart sends the correct items and discount. Your theme or app then decides how to show the cart (drawer or redirect) by listening to the events the widget dispatches.

*Optional: add a short video or GIF here showing the flow from selection → price update → add to cart → cart drawer.*

## 🛒 Cart Drawer – Works With Any Setup

The widget does **not** assume a specific cart. After adding to cart it dispatches events; your theme or app handles the rest.

| Your setup | What to do |
|------------|------------|
| **Native theme drawer** | If the theme already listens for `cart-drawer:open` and `cart:update`, often no extra code. Optionally set **Cart section IDs** in the block. |
| **Custom drawer** | Listen for `bundle:cart-added`; open your drawer and update from `e.detail.cart` and/or `e.detail.sections`. |
| **Cart drawer app** | App listens for `bundle:cart-added` and refreshes/opens its drawer using `e.detail.cart` or `e.detail.sections`. |
| **Redirect to cart** | Listen for `bundle:cart-added` and set `window.location.href = '/cart'`. |

Optional theme cart display (heading, bubble count) only runs if you include the `bundle-cart-adapter` snippet – see [Cart drawer integration](docs/cart-drawer-integration.md).

## 📚 Code Documentation

### JavaScript events

**`bundle:cart-added`** – Use this for custom or app-based cart drawers.

```js
document.addEventListener('bundle:cart-added', (e) => {
  const { cart, itemCount, sections } = e.detail;
  // cart: full cart JSON from /cart.js
  // itemCount: number of items
  // sections: { [sectionId]: htmlString } if section IDs were requested
});
```

**`bundle:selected`** – Fired when a bundle tier is selected (for custom integrations).

```js
document.addEventListener('bundle:selected', (event) => {
  // event.detail: price, comparePrice, quantity, formattedPrice, freeGiftVariantId, freeGiftQuantity
});
```

### Block settings (overview)

- **General:** Product image, free gift image.
- **Badge:** Design (circle, tag, shield, etc.), animation (shimmer, gradient), size, text color, vertical position; mobile overrides.
- **Cart (optional):** Cart section IDs – comma-separated section IDs to request when adding to cart.
- **Per tier:** Enable, title, quantity, price type (percentage/fixed), discount code, free gift, badges, colors.

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Bundle selection updates the button price
- [ ] Quantity input syncs with bundle selection
- [ ] Free gifts are added to cart correctly
- [ ] Cart drawer opens or redirect to cart works after add
- [ ] Cart shows correct quantities and prices
- [ ] Mobile layout and badge overrides work
- [ ] Works with variant selector (e.g. size/color)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| Button price not updating | Ensure `enhanced-add-to-cart.js` is loaded and the product form uses the enhanced snippet or has the expected selectors. |
| Cart drawer not updating | Theme must listen for `cart-drawer:open` / `cart:update` or for `bundle:cart-added`. Set **Cart section IDs** in the block if your theme uses specific section IDs. See [Cart drawer integration](docs/cart-drawer-integration.md). |
| Free gifts not adding | Check free gift product is published and in stock; variant ID in block settings is correct. |
